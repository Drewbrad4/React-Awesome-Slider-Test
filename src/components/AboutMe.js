                    <br />

                    <h3 className="about-text">I'm an alum of Vanguard University, I have my BA in Marketing. I’m a current student at LEARN Academy, learning full-stack web development. I’m also an actor around San Diego! </h3><br />

                    <h3 className="about-text">I was getting work as an actor but finding it difficult to find a Marketing job that allowed me to continue to perform. So I was lucky enough to find a very flexible job working in Manufacturing soldering circuit boards for water quality monitors. I learned a TON about quickly picking up new skills as I had no previous soldering experience but was taught everything on the job and picked it up fast.</h3> <br />

                    <h3 className="bottom-about">With COVID unfortunately removing theater for the time being, I felt it was an excellent time to transition to a career I had more interest in. I have always had a passion for tech in general and I felt coding helped blend my analytical side with all the creative avenues I have in my life. I am getting a comprehensive full stack education at LEARN and getting a lot of project-based learning experience and I’m loving every minute of it. Planned graduation is February 2020.</h3>
